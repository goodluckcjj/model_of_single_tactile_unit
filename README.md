# model_of_single_tactile_unit
This is the code for the paper "Simulating cutaneous tactile receptors and the spiking responses of their afferents using an electromechanical circuit model"#

The source code of current model was presented in the function "tactile_units_simulating()" in file of receptor.py, which correctly implements the diagram as illustrated in Fig 1(a) in the paper. All the simulation results in section 3 of the paper were produced by calling this funtion. 

The result figures in the paper and their corresponding code file are shown as follows:
